# Roblox Islands Autoclicker

![AFK Spirit Crystal Farm](/spirit-crystal.gif)

This is my [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script for [Roblox Islands](https://www.roblox.com/games/4872321990/Islands)

You can simply download and run the executables `main.exe` from the latest [release](https://github.com/deen24id/roblox-islands-autoclicker/releases).

Or, you can follow these steps to run the `main.ahk` script:

1. Download the [AutoHotkey V2](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe).
2. Either [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or simply download script `main.ahk` file from the latest [release](https://github.com/deen24id/roblox-islands-autoclicker/releases).
3. Run the script with the AutoHotkey program.

This script enables you to automate:

- Watering flower.
- Harvesting flower.
- Harvesting and replanting spirit crystals.
- Basic auto clicker and repeat jump.

Despite that you can click `start` or `end` button manually,
it is better to use the keyboard shortcut `shift + enter` or `shift + escape`.
You may know this information by reading this README while I figure out how to add tooltip to the GUI.
