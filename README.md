# Roblox Islands Autoclicker

This is my [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script for [Roblox Islands](https://www.roblox.com/games/4872321990/Islands)

You have to download the [AutoHotkey V2](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe) first, and run the scipt with that program.

This script enables you to automate:

- Watering flower.
- Harvesting flower.
- Harvesting and replanting spirit crystals.
- Basic auto clicker and repeat jump.

Despite that you can click `start` or `end` button manually,
it is better to enter keyboard shortcut `shift + enter` or `shift + escape`.
You may know this information by reading this while I figure out how to add tooltip to the GUI.
